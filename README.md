Firstly, start the application without seeding. Stop the application.
Install the packages listed below:

1) npm i -g sqlite3
2) npm i -g sequelize-cli

Then run sequelize db:seed:all which will seed universities.

The SQLite Db file will be placed into db directory.
For browsing DB data you can use DB Browser for SQLite.

Enjoy :)
